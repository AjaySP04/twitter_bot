# twitter_bot

This is a twiiter bot that is used to favorite some tweets with similar hashtag present on it.

Here we search specific tags and on that tags we are checking if the tweet is already favorite or not.

If the tweet is  not favorite and contain the the searched Hashtag( eg #NodeJS) than it will be favorite.

Right now the we are favoriting only 10 tweets per run. This is a a Node JS app so feel free to run this code on your local set up.

use "node index.js" to run this.


Note: This code is in developement for more functonality and will change on weekly basis.
